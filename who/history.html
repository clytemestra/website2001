My parents are both from rural towns in the      <A HREF="http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/">central part of south      Louisiana</A> where parents still teach their children French      and coffee is a social requisite. I don't know why they didn't      stay in this wonderfully culture-rich community. In any case,      perhaps seeking a brighter future, they succumbed to the lure      of the big money rumored to be had in the oil industry and moved      to Morgan City in the early sixties. </FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The details of my life in Morgan City are      already well-known to those who have any business knowing them.      </FONT></P>          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the spring of <a href="historypics.html">my             sophomore year </a>at Morgan City High School, my application to the             Louisana School for Math, Science, and the Arts (<A HREF="http://www.lsmsa.edu/">LSMSA</A>)             was accepted. LSMSA is one of those strange hybrids of public and             private schools--a publicly funded boarding school to which one must             pay tution to attend. Thrilled at the prospect of escape, I pounced.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Encouraged to apply by my Latin teacher,      I won a scholarship at the <A HREF="http://www.cua.edu/">Catholic      University of America</A>. Not one to refuse money, I enrolled.</FONT>      <FONT FACE="Arial">And so I spent my first year of college in      Washington, D.C., but after discovering that I wasn't rich, religious,      or from New Jersey, I left to pursue an exciting career in the      hazardous waste industry. </FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After about a year or so of getting to      know 40 CFR and OSHA regulations and answering phones, I was      ready to take on Latin and Greek again and enrolled part-time      at LSU. Commuting 80 miles between work and school is something      I would not recommend.</FONT></P>          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I moved to Baton Rouge in 1994, got married, and             enrolled full-time. Between 1994 and 1998, I quit school entirely             several times, got divorced, and read lots of good books. In August             of 1998, I finally <a href="historypics.html#LSU">received my bachelor             of arts</a> in Latin from<B> </B><A HREF="http://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana             State University</A>, in Baton Rouge, La. (along with Jason).</FONT>          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After graduation and after             living in Baton Rouge for four years in my case and eight in Jason's,             we decided, rather precipitously, to move to Fayetteville, Ark., where             his grandmother and aunt had lived for several years. After about             two months of unemployment (during which I taught myself how to write             poetry in meter, just for fun), I suddenly had two part-time jobs,             one as an editorial assistant at a <a href="http://www.uark.edu/meteor">planetary             science journal </a>housed in the basement of the chemistry building             at the University of Arkansas and one as a &quot;bookseller&quot;             at the local Barnes and Noble. </font>          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I worked very hard and             eventually got on full-time at guess which one.That's where I met             <a href="http://comp.uark.edu/%7Epbenoit/">Paul</a>, who is Canadian             by birth, whose last name is Benoit, and who knows what Cajuns are.             This led to some furious family history research on both of our parts             and the ambiguous discovery of a Marie Benoit in both. So, we're cousins,             right? I don't know--dark hair, dark eyes, strange gothic hobbies.             Seems obvious to me.</font>         </TD>  </TR></TABLE></CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>    <A HREF="../index.html"><MAP NAME="barMap1"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="525,6,560,50" HREF="../index.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="399,6,521,50" HREF="../work.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="285,6,398,51" HREF="../links.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="163,4,283,53" HREF="../gallery.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="41,3,163,54" HREF="whoami.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="1,2,40,54" HREF="../index.html"> </MAP><IMG SRC="../Photos/icons/bar.gif" WIDTH="564" HEIGHT="56"ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP USEMAP="#barMap1"></A>   </CENTER></H1></BODY></HTML>
