My education      is in Latin, with a little bit of Greek, and classical literature.</FONT></P>      <H3><FONT FACE="Arial">History/Story of My Life</FONT></H3>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">One of the things that I have learned on      my classical journey is that the word 'history' in Greek (historia)      has as its original meaning 'story,' and only later came to be      used in the sense with which we are familiar. So, in the tradition      of <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/sor?lookup=Herodotus">Herodotus</A>,      'the father of history,' I will hereafter copiously intersperse      commentary with the dry, boring facts of my existence.</FONT></P>      <P><A HREF="history.html"><FONT FACE="Arial">[more]</FONT></A></P>      <H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Senseless Drivel</FONT></H3>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I feel that getting to know me ought to      be like peeling an onion, as you strip the layers away, I make      you cry. I generally dislike this sort of self-absorbed prattle,      but the imminent approach of the dreaded, proverbial tenth-year      class reunion and various other late-twenties crises have forced      me to face and re-examine that odd little concept that we call      'self'.</FONT></P>      <P><A HREF="drivel.html"><FONT FACE="Arial">[more]</FONT></A></P>      <H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Litanies of Likes &amp; Dislikes</FONT></H3>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For some reason, when asked about ourselves,      the second easiest response (after what we do for a living) is      rattling off things like our favorite TV shows or musicians or      completely unsolicited personal opinions.</FONT></P>      <P><A HREF="rants_raves.html"><FONT FACE="Arial">[here are      mine]</FONT></A></P>      <H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Associates/Influences</FONT></H3>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although we are not (exactly) defined by      the people with whom we associate and whom we call 'friend,'      we are most certainly influenced and guided by them just as we      are molded (though not defined) by our experiences. [This will      eventually spotlight friends, teachers, bosses &amp; co-workers,      people I hate and decided not to be like, people i used to like      but now thoroughly disgust me, and various others.]</FONT>    </TD>  </TR></TABLE></CENTER><H1><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>    <A HREF="../index.html"><MAP NAME="barMap1"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="525,6,560,50" HREF="../index.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="399,6,521,50" HREF="../work.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="285,6,398,51" HREF="../links.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="163,4,283,53" HREF="../gallery.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="41,3,163,54" HREF="whoami.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="1,2,40,54" HREF="../index.html"> </MAP><IMG SRC="../Photos/icons/bar.gif" WIDTH="564" HEIGHT="56"ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP USEMAP="#barMap1"></A>   </CENTER></H1></BODY></HTML>
