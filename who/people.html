With my usual cynicism,             I immediately decided that she was entirely too gregarious for me.             I knew not what the future held. George now lives in Boston in her             very own house with her very own Jennifer. George and Jennifer have             four cats who liked to be called Drat, Niblet, Raymond, and Choco.             (And if she would send some pictures, like I told her to, you would             be able to tell them hello.) George is also working towards a degree             in Philosophy at UMass Boston and working on a book on Julia Tyler             for a new First Ladies series being published by NOVA. </FONT></P>      <H3><A HREF="people/joren.html"><FONT FACE="Arial">Joren</FONT></A></H3>          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I also met a guy named Chris, who went to Berkeley             and became a lawyer. Joren is happily newly married, and apparently             enjoys helping people apply for U.S. citizenship. He's really bright             guy with a lot of lofty ideals.</FONT></P>      <H3><A HREF="people/cash.html"><FONT FACE="Arial">Cashman</FONT></A></H3>          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Cashman finished MIT in 3 1/2 years and now has             more money than God. He likes to travel, and is also happily newly             married. Cashman has graduated from software engineer into management             and is currently working to make sure that more spam can be sent to             more poeple faster.</FONT></P>      <H3><A HREF="http://comp.uark.edu/~pbenoit"><FONT FACE="Arial">Paul</FONT></A></H3>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I met Paul while working at Meteoritics      and Planetary Science in Fayetteville, Ark. Marie Benoit appears      in both our family tree, so we must be related. Right? He likes      to travel, too, and, like Cashman, has been to Antarctia on a      scientific rock-gathering expedition. I find it quite amazing      that I know two people who have been to the least-visited and,      until recently, only uninhabited continent on the planet. But      then again, my mind is easily boggled. By the way, he actually      lives within the 1K mi. radius, but I guess it doesn't really      matter how far away your friends live when you refuse to fly.</FONT>    </TD>  </TR></TABLE></CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>    <MAP NAME="Map"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="3,3,40,52" HREF="../index.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="43,5,160,52" HREF="../who.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="165,6,282,52" HREF="../gallery.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="285,4,398,52" HREF="../links.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="401,5,523,51" HREF="../work.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="525,4,559,51" HREF="../index.html"> </MAP><IMG SRC="../Photos/icons/bar.gif" USEMAP="#Map" BORDER="0"ALIGN="BOTTOM" ISMAP WIDTH="564" HEIGHT="56" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> &nbsp;   </CENTER></H1></BODY></HTML>
