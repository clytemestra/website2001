I find this highly amusing.</FONT></P>          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I hate Elmo. But I think <A HREF="http://www.pokemon.com/">Pikachu</A>             is the greatest. David Bowie is God and always will be. I once ran             off a roommate by playing Space Oddity over and over and over and             over. I have three cats, <A HREF="cats/babykitty.html">Baby Kitty</A>,             <A HREF="cats/dante.html">Dante</A>, and <A HREF="cats/peep.html">Vergil</A>             (who goes by &quot;Peep&quot;). All of my friends live at least 1000             miles away from me, no matter where I live. I hate the mountains,             and the people who live in the mountains hate me. I am more nocturnal             than my cats. Growing up in a <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~polyphemos/mc.html">less             than cosmopolitan area</A>, I learned how to discover literature and             philosophy through popular culture (watch an episode of Star Trek             and try to track down all the literary references, I dare you). I             believe that science fiction is a mask worn by writers enabling unhindered             exploration of religion, philosophy, and some of the more interesting             questions and aspects of life in a widely accessible public forum.             I believe that most of what is on television is utter trash. I watch             TV anyway.</FONT>         </TD>  </TR></TABLE></CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></H1><H1><CENTER>    <A HREF="../index.html"><MAP NAME="barMap1"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="525,6,560,50" HREF="../index.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="399,6,521,50" HREF="../work.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="285,6,398,51" HREF="../links.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="163,4,283,53" HREF="../gallery.html"> <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="41,3,163,54" HREF="whoami.html">       <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="1,2,40,54" HREF="../index.html"> </MAP><IMG SRC="../Photos/icons/bar.gif" WIDTH="564" HEIGHT="56"ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP USEMAP="#barMap1"></A>   </CENTER></H1></BODY></HTML>
