Tuesday's after-hour activities   included a trip to Nottoway Plantation for a tour and dinner.&nbsp; Then on   Wednesday, ten of the workshop participants took a tour of the Atchafalaya Basin   swamp in Breaux Bridge where they experienced Louisiana culture, cuisine, and   even got to see an alligator! Everyone agrees that this year's workshop was   a fabulous success! <p>-Jennifer Guillory<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
